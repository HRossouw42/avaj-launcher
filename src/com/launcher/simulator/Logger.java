/*
If an aircraft reaches height 0 or needs to go below it,
the aircraft lands, unregisters from the weather tower
and logs its current coordinates

When a weather change occurs, each aircraft type needs to log a message.
The message format is: TYPE#NAME(UNIQUE_ID): SPECIFIC_MESSAGE.
A funny message will be appreciated during the correction.

Each time an aircraft registers or unregisters
to/from the weather tower, a message will be logged.
